# E-Commerce Backend [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
  
  ## Description
  Mock e-commerce backend using Node.js and Sequelize. 

  This application is meant to show our understanding of RESTful APIs through a mock retail backend. From the started code we were given, we built all models used in to sort the data as well as the routes used to retrieve that data. 

  This challenge, while tough, helped me to better understand the flow of the backend process and file structure.
